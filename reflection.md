Included with your pull request, you must submit answers to the following questions:

* What do you think we were trying to get you to learn with this challenge?

  >How to build a hash, and iterate over it? "Breaking a problem down into logical components" seems like the standard answer.


* Outline in words (at least 5-6 sentences) what your code is doing in order to solve this problem.

  >The overall idea is to identify an activity, specify a total cost for that activity, recruit people to participate in the activity, then split the bill for the cost.  Further down the road, it looks like the program will allow for a menu of activities, people can choose some, all or none of the activities, then be billed for each.

* What was the most difficult portion of this for you?

  >Like always, I don't know where to start.  Do I need to make a participant class? Do I make participants in the activity class? Does the activity start with a base cost that's initialized with the new instance of the activity? How will I finish this in less than two hours? 

* What came naturally to you?

  >Nothing.
